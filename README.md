## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any [Airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the [jest](https://jestjs.io/) unit test.
